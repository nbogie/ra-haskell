Beginner haskell implementation of Reiner Knizia's game, Ra.
http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12/ra

This is just on github as a backup of a learning project.  It is NOT a good example of haskell to learn from.

No AI, no GUI (just a messy text interface).  Only implemented for 3 players (though it would be a trivial change to give full support).

The main issue with this current implementation is the incomplete separation of IO from game logic.
