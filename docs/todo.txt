* improve types so that certain tiles are not holdable in a hand (disasters and Ra tiles).
* multiple ui's - e.g. curses interface - will highlight game/ui boundary
* note: it is valid to bid on an empty auction (you may wish to gain a better sun)
* check what happens when we choose to god, but there is nothing pickable (only other god tiles, say).
* leverage the typed scoring by providing a scoring breakdown in the UI, and maybe a hint mode telling you what the current block is immediately worth to you.
* note: with the correct tileset, you should never run out of tiles before end of 3rd Epoch.  If you tweak the tileset, ensure there are at least 30 Ra tiles.

DONE:
* correct the design: when the block is full, an auction isn't automatically called - player may call ra, OR use god(s) if held. Remember this invocation of ra is classed involuntary.
* implement forced bidding for caller when auction has been called voluntarily and no one else has bid
* implemented no-user-choice disaster resolution
* implement user-choice during resolution of unrest and quake
