* output score in both versions
* multiple ui's - e.g. curses, gloss - will highlight game/ui boundary
* leverage the typed scoring by providing a scoring breakdown in the UI, and maybe a hint mode telling you what the current block is immediately worth to you.
* improve types to enforce that certain tiles (Ra tiles) cannot be held in the auction block. (already, certain cannot be held in the hand).

DONE:
* player having highest sun at the start of an epoch starts that epoch
* reflect number of each tile in store
* when drawing store when in mode ResolveDisastersAfterAuction (or after god), populate store with store + remaining candidates from block (those not already used in an autoresolution)
* improve types so that certain tiles are not holdable in a hand (disasters and Ra tiles), enforced by the type system.  See docs/question_tiletypes.txt and the commit https://github.com/nbogie/ra-haskell/commit/77c16fdbb6627156f7a3f78b1c37c9730d7c4e79
* handle case where all players run out of suns before end of epoch
* correct the design: when the block is full, an auction isn't automatically called - player may call ra, OR use god(s) if held. Remember this invocation of ra is classed involuntary.
* implement forced bidding for caller when auction has been called voluntarily and no one else has bid
* implemented no-user-choice disaster resolution
* implement user-choice during resolution of unrest and quake
* support full number of players (2-5)
